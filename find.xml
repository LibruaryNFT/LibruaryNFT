            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Afterfuture — Artist Spotlight — New Drop coming soon! #onFlow</h3><blockquote>With Afterfuture dropping their next big art release on the Flow Blockchain, we at <a href="https://find.xyz/">.find</a> wanted to get the inside scoop for collectors before the release. Enjoy this Q&amp;A from the Afterfuture team.</blockquote><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2QookIzk9jfS7b2cfFLPdA.gif" /></figure><p><strong>To kick things off, can you tell us a bit about yourself and your background as an artist?</strong><br>My name is Angel, and I’m the co-founder of Afterfuture. I started back in 2016 creating 3D stuff just for fun and saw the boom on Instagram that was happening back then, so I jumped on the wagon and started creating pieces every single day from early 2017 to late 2018.</p><p><strong>What inspired you to create an NFT collection?</strong><br>Specifically for Generated Experiences, it was a random idea that I thought sounded cool, like having an actual research facility named GENXP and the researchers simulating different artifacts in a strange old-looking machine that is futuristic at the same time.</p><p><strong>How did you approach the creative process for this particular collection?</strong><br>I started with the trailer first, which took quite some time to finish, and then the video loops, which is kind of weird, but I thought that’d speed up my process and making the still artworks would be the easier part, which definitely helped me a lot in the process. I started thinking about the rarities as well as the direction we’re going in because the story was pretty rough at the time.</p><p>(Currently, this platform doesn’t support .mov files, so be sure to check out on social media)</p><p><strong>Can you walk us through some of the themes and motifs that are present in your NFT artwork?</strong><br>We love creating pieces that are linked to nature and technology, working hand in hand. It’s always been our idea to create this harmony between those 2 completely different realities yet they’re in sync.</p><p><strong>How do you see the intersection of art and technology evolving in the future?</strong><br>Can’t say much about that because art and technology are evolving every single day, softwares are getting some incredible quality of life updates, technology is improving like no tomorrow, so it’s pretty easy to start creating art today.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mECF0ENe_I0rGGLKjKybyQ.jpeg" /><figcaption>Afterfuture piece from the Versus Collection</figcaption></figure><p><strong>What advice would you give to other artists who are interested in creating NFTs?</strong><br>Just go for it, it never hurts to try out another space the same way we did, we came back in late 2020 and ended up loving it. Build slowly, interact with the community you’re going to be part of, reward the people supporting you, and things will happen.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us about any upcoming projects or collaborations that you’re excited about?</strong><br>I haven’t been around that much lately because of the amount of work we’ve been doing for Generated Experiences and other projects, but the 2 projects that I’m always excited to see expand are .find and Flovatar.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3BG7jM6_w9gbUMaGK3GJYA.png" /><figcaption>Afterfuture Artwork from their Starly Collection</figcaption></figure><p><strong>How do you think NFTs will impact the art world in the long term?</strong><br>I think that NFTs have impacted the art world like no other wave before that, giving artists their freedom, the blockchain footprint of their work and royalties. I think it will help artists in the future to expand their brand, vision and maybe try some new ventures.</p><p><strong>Finally, where can collectors go to view and purchase your NFT collection on our marketplace?</strong><br>We’ve been on Flow for quite some time at this point, so collectors can explore our pieces and their stories at Versus, Starly, xtingles and very soon .find.</p><p>There you have it, some insight into the creators of the Generated Experiences collection, dropping on .find this Friday, 12-May! These are artists who have promoted and build #onFlow since the beginning.</p><p>You can .find more details on the official drop page here: <a href="https://find.xyz/afterfuture/pack/1">https://find.xyz/afterfuture/pack/1</a></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*M2fSuGGNY7PEBodZRTHrkg.gif" /></figure><h3>Helpful Links:</h3><h4>.find:</h4><p>Website: <a href="https://find.xyz/lf/thoughts">https://find.xyz</a><br>Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/findonflow">https://discord.gg/findonflow<br></a>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/findonflow">https://twitter.com/findonflow</a><br>Roadmap: <a href="https://roadmap.find.xyz/">https://roadmap.find.xyz/</a></p><h4>Afterfuture:</h4><p>Drop Page: <a href="https://find.xyz/afterfuture/pack/1">https://find.xyz/afterfuture/pack/1</a><br>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/afterfuture_nft">https://twitter.com/afterfuture_nft</a></p><h4>Author:</h4><p>Erick White <a href="https://twitter.com/Erick_makes_Art">https://twitter.com/Erick_makes_Art</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=2c66c9ffd6b4" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>How to send Doodles 2 Wearables to Non-Custodial Wallets: A Guide by .find</h3><blockquote>Looking for a hassle-free way to move your Doodles 2 Wearables to a non-Custodial wallet? This blog post is for you.</blockquote><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_lPL52reUmjBIpfUiHWMqA.png" /></figure><h4>Overview:</h4><p>If you’re looking for a hassle-free way to move your Doodles 2 Wearables to non-Dapper wallets, you’ve come to the right place. The .find team have created a feature to move your wearables between ALL wallets, both custodial and non-custodial. Follow these steps to move your Wearables quickly and easily:</p><p>Follow the steps below to move your wearables from Dapper to non-Dapper wallets quickly and easily.</p><h4>Condensed version of steps:</h4><ol><li>Create a non-Dapper wallet</li><li>Setup your .find profile</li><li>Utilize .find’s send feature</li><li>That’s it.</li></ol><p>For more details, keep reading.</p><h4>1. Create Non-Dapper Wallet:</h4><p>If you don’t have a non-Dapper wallet yet, choose one that best suits your needs from options such as NuFi, Lilico, Flipper, or Blocto. Once you’ve created your wallet, you will need to activate the wearables collection to receive Wearables on the Flow Blockchain.</p><p>There are a handful of options to choose from and each have their merits: <a href="https://nu.fi/"><strong>NuFi</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://lilico.app/"><strong>Lilico</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://flipper.org/?utm_source=Flowverse&amp;utm_medium=Website&amp;utm_campaign=Dapp"><strong>Flipper</strong></a><strong>, &amp; </strong><a href="https://blocto.io/"><strong>Blocto</strong></a><strong> (&amp; possibly others by the time you read this).</strong></p><h4>Step 2: Setup your .find profile</h4><p>Navigate to the .find <a href="https://find.xyz/">website</a> and activate the wearables contract. After logging in with your non-Dapper wallet, set up your new account and click “Train Me” on your dashboard to prepare your wallet to receive Wearables. Be sure to have $Flow in your wallet to cover the gas fees for these transactions.</p><blockquote>If this is your first time logging in with a new wallet, you will be guided through a streamlined profile activation phase. This does incur a small gas fee, so be sure to have some $Flow in your wallet.</blockquote><p>Your wallet is now ready to receive Wearables!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*V1WmLnycla0J9GGpldr3yg.png" /><figcaption>Graphic showing users where to .find the actuate the collection</figcaption></figure><h4>Step 3: Login with your Dapper Wallet</h4><p>Log in with your Dapper wallet and navigate to the NFT Detail Page under the COLLECTIONS tab on your dashboard. Select the Wearable you wish to move, click “SEND,” enter your address or .find name, and confirm the transaction.</p><blockquote>Note: Sending Wearables via the .find platform is simple and easy. Attempting to send them through Dapper wallet UI will prompt additional steps.</blockquote><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RycSGRF5zPpVCsXegqPoAQ.png" /><figcaption>Graphic showing users they need to login to find.xyz with their Dapper wallet to send Wearables.</figcaption></figure><h4>Ready to Go!</h4><p>That’s it! Your Doodles 2 Wearables will be transferred from your Dapper wallet to the non-Dapper wallet address you specified. Be sure to double-check the destination address before confirming the transfer to avoid any mistakes. You can use .find names to simplify the address and make it more human-readable. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to us through our Discord or social media channels. Happy transacting!</p><blockquote>Using .find names can be advantageous as they offer an easy-to-remember name for complex 0x… addresses. Moreover, .find names work seamlessly on various platforms within the Flow Ecosystem, making the transfer process even more streamlined as well as sharing your collection with friends.</blockquote><p>We hope you enjoyed this short informative posts, if you have further questions feel free to reach out to us in our Discord or on social media, links below.</p><p>Have a Doodley day!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LLqg6MZQthgKS3XZ77NxYw.png" /><figcaption>Graphic showing common issues users might face when sending wearables</figcaption></figure><h4>Some Common Issues:</h4><ul><li><strong>Not having enough Flow</strong> — While transaction are really cheap #onFlow, you will need some Flow to setup your accounts. Additionally, Flow wallets can run out of storage if they don’t contain enough Flow tokens. So consider seeding your new wallet with at least 5 Flow to never worry again!</li><li><strong>Not actuating first</strong> — If you try and send the wearables to your non-dapper wallet, before actuating the Wearables contract, the transaction will fail!</li><li><strong>Using Dapper UI</strong> — if you try sending wearables via the Dapper UI, instead of using the .find platform, you might run into additional steps that could slow down the process.</li></ul><blockquote>Consider storing 5 Flow in your wallet to never worry about transaction fees or storage issues.</blockquote><h3>Helpful Links:</h3><h4>.find:</h4><p>Website: <a href="https://find.xyz/lf/thoughts">https://find.xyz</a><br>Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/findonflow">https://discord.gg/findonflow<br></a>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/findonflow">https://twitter.com/findonflow</a><br>Roadmap: <a href="https://roadmap.find.xyz/">https://roadmap.find.xyz/</a></p><h4>Doodles</h4><p>Website: <a href="https://doodles.app/">https://doodles.app/</a><br>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/doodles">https://twitter.com/doodles</a></p><h4>Author:</h4><p>Erick White <a href="https://twitter.com/Erick_makes_Art">https://twitter.com/Erick_makes_Art</a></p><h4>Benefits of Cadence:</h4><p><a href="https://flow.com/post/flow-blockchain-cadence-programming-language-resources-assets">https://flow.com/post/flow-blockchain-cadence-programming-language-resources-assets</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=cc9c9ef8f00e" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Doodles .find their Flow</h3><blockquote>The Doodles team has launched Doodles 2 on the Flow Blockchain, which is rather exciting for current and future Flow enthusiasts! Here, we discuss Find’s role in assisting with this expansion from Ethereum to Flow, take a closer look at what we do, and examine some of the awesome new features we are implementing.</blockquote><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UlqdPq76ZqNToBVUlWCHDw.gif" /></figure><h3>Overview</h3><p>Creativity and innovation are key players in the world of NFTs. One specific project has been making waves in the industry, Doodles. Known for its unique approach to NFTs, Doodles are now taking a big step, in the right direction, by expanding onto the Flow blockchain with Doodles 2.</p><blockquote><em>Excitingly, the backend expansion of Doodles 2 is being handled by us here at .find.</em></blockquote><h3>Going with the Flow 🌊</h3><p>While Ethereum was an excellent theatre for stage one, the Doodles team had found themselves constrained by challenges such as network congestion, high gas prices and complex onboarding experience.</p><p>The wizards at Doodles, who are constantly seeking to expand their creative and technological cauldrons, needed the space and freedom to do so. They selected the Flow blockchain for their expansion to Doodles 2 because of the interoperability of Flow across various platforms, including social media, events, gaming, and streaming. Working with .find has enabled Doodles to build a robust architecture on Flow that will scale on demand. The Doodles community, and those new to the fun, can look forward to easy onboarding, frictionless interactions and checkout experiences when exploring the delights of Doodles 2.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Security</em></strong><em> — Users will also enjoy the </em><a href="https://flow.com/post/flow-blockchain-cadence-programming-language-resources-assets"><em>enhanced safety and security benefits of Cadence</em></a><em>, Flow’s unique resource-oriented programming language.</em></blockquote><h3>.find out what we built for Doodles</h3><p>If you, like us, relish in a little more detail, here are the highlights of what .find actually built for Doodles:</p><ul><li><strong>Core Flow contracts.</strong> We have been working with Doodles and their partners to create, test, and refine their NFT, admin and wearables contracts. To achieve this we used the new default implementation in interfaces feature in Flow to create some really nice new patterns in Cadence, which in turn offered new and bespoke functions within the Doodles contracts.</li><li><strong>Trusted Ethereum to Flow bridge — <em>the Dooplicator</em></strong> As the name suggests, the Dooplicator we built is a verified trusted bridge to securely and seamlessly Dooplicate the Doodles from Ethereum to Flow.

Since we opened last year, our platform has grown at an impressive rate, adding more capabilities and features, and the first names have begun to expire.</p><p>Users have 3-months to renew their names, after the three months, the names will be released to the public allowing other users to claim them.</p><p>No fret though, extending your favorite .find names is an easy process and will be explained here!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WZk0CWgqR-oIrjpk9NJO9A.gif" /><figcaption>Time to Renew!</figcaption></figure><h3>Step by Step:</h3><h4>Step 1 - Login with Blocto:</h4><p>First is self-explanatory, navigate to the .find website and login with your Blocto wallet, soon users will also be able to create a profile using their Dapper Wallet (Exciting!) but for now utilise Blocto.</p><h4>Step 2 — Navigate to your Dashboard</h4><p>The user Dashboard hosts a lot of helpful information, so feel free to spend some time in this area to see all the helpful features .find has to offer!</p><p><strong>Desktop: </strong>This is found on the left hand side — when you hover your mouse over the left panel, it will pop-out and you can then click (Dashboard).</p><p><strong>Mobile: </strong>After logging in, you might find yourself already on the dashboard page, if not, click the hamburger menu on the top right and select (Dashboard).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1012/1*t1nvX6EGyguYj8vPrN9qMw.png" /><figcaption>Left: Desktop View / Right: Mobile View</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Step 3 — find and select the (Names) Tab</strong></h4><p>Next you will need to navigate to the <strong>NAMES </strong>tab.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Enjoy Flow NFTs, all in one place — .find links with Emerald DAO</h3><blockquote>The .find platform has established a link with the Emerald DAO to provide more content to users of the .find platform.</blockquote><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1012/1*nXYiER00YXM9FFee3o3Bag.png" /><figcaption>.find links with Emerald ID</figcaption></figure><h4>Overview</h4><p>When it comes to owning NFTs, viewing your entire collection is one of the many joys within the Web3 space. This was often time consuming and confusing on Flow Blockchain because collections were often spread out between different wallets and platforms. No longer is that the case now that .find has implemented a link with the Emerald City.</p><p>Now, users only have to complete two simple steps to have access to majority of the NFTs on Flow Blockchain.</p><blockquote>View Lillico, Blocto, and Dapper NFTs all in one place.</blockquote><h4>.find Platform</h4><p>The .find platform already allowed users the ability to sign-in and link their Blocto wallets to their profile, this new integration now opens the door to easily view both Dapper and Lillico NFTs as well as Blocto NFTs. Exciting times to view all your NFTs in one place.</p><p>This integration allows for <em>viewing</em> of your entire collection, but only Blocto NFTs can be traded. We are in the process of fully integrating the Dapper Wallet, allowing users the ability to trade Dapper NFTs so keep a look out for that announcement!</p><h4>The Emerald ID</h4><p>The Emerald ID is an impressive system built by the Emerald DAO team. It has been around for a couple months allowing users the ability to link certain Flow wallets to a distinct Discord handle.</p><p>By linking users wallets to their Discord handle, users are able to easily verify NFT ownership when bouncing between Discord servers.</p><p>Currently, the Emerald ID supports three different wallets: Lillico, Blocto, and Dapper wallets. If you have one or more of these wallets, you can link them to your Emerald ID and your .find profile will automatically update if you are a current .find user.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1012/1*0OalY-XZZ_j3vl41WomaHg.png" /><figcaption>Available Wallets to Link</figcaption></figure><h4>Easy Setup:</h4><p>The integration is possible in <em>two</em> easy steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step One:</strong> Create a .find profile here — <a href="http://www.find.xyz">www.find.xyz</a></li><li><strong>Step Two: </strong>Create and link all your wallets to a Emerald DAO account here: <a href="https://id.ecdao.org/">https://id.ecdao.org/</a></li><li><strong>Note:</strong> If you already have a .find profile and Emerald ID, then your account is already good-to-go! You can begin enjoying all your NFTs</li></ul><h4>No Discord?</h4><p>Currently, the Emerald ID works by linking your wallets to a distinct Discord handle. Understanding not all users utilise Discord, .find is in the process of enabling our own wallet linkage system for users who don’t want the required Discord portion of Emerald ID. So stay tuned!</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>We at .find are constantly moving forward with empowering users and always open to collaborating with other builders. The ability to work with Emerald DAO on this collaborative piece has opened doors for new users to enjoy their Flow NFT collections.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1012/1*Lr-fLVSF36Iiq54gj6MWZA.png" /><figcaption>How the new feature looks on .find</figcaption></figure><p>So what are you waiting for?

These expressions showcase our fluctuating moods and unique characters. At .find, we want to allow users the ability to etch their ideas in a virtual stone wall.</p><blockquote>As the famous line goes, “I think, therefore I am”.</blockquote><h4>An Online Persona</h4><p>At .find, we strive to support our users in expressing their individuality through a myriad of ways. From custom profiles, to unique wallet names, to solidifying their “thoughts” on the Flow Blockchain; we strive to empower our users in all aspects of their digital identity.</p><p>And this is only the beginning. Our first iteration of this platform allows users to post permanent content to the “live-feed”, via one simple and fast transaction.</p><h4>Version 1.0: “Thoughts Launch on .find”</h4><p>With the current build, users can:</p><ul><li>Post permanent “Thoughts” directly to the live-feed using a Blocto Wallet (subsidised gas fees via Blocto).</li><li>React to other user “Thoughts” using different emojis.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1012/1*YEi4unDktcGNn3eFZKncKA.png" /></figure><h3>Our Roadmap for this Feature set:</h3><p>With the first iteration built and live, our developers are quickly coming up with new ways to interact with this new feature.</p><p>Planned features for the “Thoughts” Platform:</p><ul><li>Allow users to <em>edit</em> their posts</li><li>Delete “Thoughts”</li><li>Add images; link NFTs to their “Thoughts”</li><li>Reply to other .find users “Thoughts”</li><li>Send Direct Messages to other .find users</li><li>Mint their thoughts as actual NFTs</li></ul><h3>Conclusion:</h3><p>This is merely the beginning of the road for this new communicative platform, and we look forward to working with users as we continually build our “Thoughts” platform.

We made that easier also!</h4><p>We added multiple new addition providing users more abilities and feedback when sending NFTs across the Flow Ecosystem.</p><ul><li><strong>Wallet information </strong>— Not all Flow NFTs are compatible with all wallets, users will now have more information concerning the receiver’s wallet allowing for more informed decisions.</li><li><strong>Messages</strong> — You can now add messages to sent NFTs, allowing the sender to leave funny comments, congratulate giveaway winners, or simply say Enjoy!</li><li><strong>New user “Inbox” Feature</strong> — Flow has a spam filter on wallets, rejecting NFTs from collections not established previously on the user’s wallet. This sometimes prevents the user from receiving NFTs they might want, so we implemented the Inbox.</li><li><strong>Tip Jar</strong> — Saving a buck is always a plus, we added a tip jar when sending NFTs offering you, the user to tip the creators and platforms when sending NFTs. This is not mandatory but we wanted to empower users with the ability to continually support the communities they enjoy.</li></ul><blockquote>NFTs sent to wallets without the corresponding collection will go to that users Inbox until claimed, and they don’t want the NFT you sent, don’t claim it, simple as that!</blockquote><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1RYBrzOid-bVcXM1trOo0Q.png" /><figcaption>Add messages before sending — image of the Tip Jar for creators</figcaption></figure><h4>Feature 10: The Furnace — Burn Baby Burn!</h4><p>We all have one or two NFTs that are no longer needed in the collection, now you can burn those unwanted pieces via our Furnace.</p><ul><li>This feature allows users to destroy unwanted NFTs</li><li>It also allows creators the ability to create interesting concepts with their projects, giving fun integrations between creator and collectors.</li></ul><blockquote>A development idea for creators: Burn one NFT and receive another, we are only scratching the surface on possibilities and believe this feature will come in handy in the years to come!</blockquote><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8Xl9Qth7AnUMsDwYnHnoAQ.png" /><figcaption>The burn Button is foudn in the NFT detail page — doesn’t work on all NFTs.</figcaption></figure><h4>Feature 11: Upgraded Roadmap Visibility</h4><p>Interested to know what we are currently working on?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The .find team would like to feature a special guest artist who is creating a small exquisite collection of Artwork for the .find platform.</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pzxvQP5Xms7ciNYlqvgdsQ.png" /></figure><p>Lapin Mignon has had an interesting career path, and has been in the NFT space since 2019, combining tangible pieces with digital accents. She has since created some beautiful art collections while building an engaged audience, with avid collectors, and the .find team is excited to be working with her on this collaborative piece.</p><p>Gender neutrality is an important topic, and we found our current automated PFPs were boxing people in, we want to change this. Lapin will be creating 4 different, gender neutral comical characters, in her unique style, specifically for .find.</p><blockquote>Plus, the community will get to decide on the final characters that join the collection — so keep a look out!</blockquote><p>Below you can see some example images on what those might look like!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*14VJj1nMfJKtKOpfZ__ByQ.jpeg" /><figcaption>Early draft of characters looking for something — Artist: Lapin Mignon</figcaption></figure><p>Our Interview Questions:</p><h4><strong>How would you describe your art style? And when did you start focusing on art as more than a hobby?</strong></h4><p>I love describing my art as <em>“Augmented Watercolour”</em>. I am obsessed with using a large array of digital tools to enhance and augment my analog watercolour. The base artwork and the final artwork are miles away from each other. Augmented Reality, Dynamic NFT, Generative Art, Animation — Name it and I’ll deep dive into it with my paintings.</p><h4><strong>So have you always been an artist?</strong></h4><p>Well, art has always been a big part of my life, but ever since 2019, I found my audience and Art family in cryptoArt. This passion motivates me to create more, and I love seeing the support from the community.</p><p>Then in 2021, my work-life balance started to become a challenge, especially with 2 young energetic boys. So in March 2022, I decided to make the jump to go mainly into NFTs, Cryptocurrencies, and NFT Advisory, while remaining an Art Advisor for Fanny Lakoubay in LAL Art.</p><h4><strong>So you did first found CryptoART in 2019?</strong></h4><p>Yeah! I discovered CryptoART in 2019, in May to be precise; I was at a point in my life where Art was a hobby, but I wasn’t finding my audience. I was exhibiting my watercolours locally, but had a fear of falling into the crafts niche segment, and not being taken serious for my artwork, my creations weren’t crafts, they are art.</p><p>Often, during holiday season, I was questioning my career as an established Marketing Executive, but was dreaming to one day break through with my Art. Often considering returning to Art School, having left 15 years ago to attend Business School…</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YgDuwL5thy0MZ9-LrDRAAA.png" /><figcaption>Eat Me Origin — Lapin Mignon</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Okay, so you wanted to make Art a full-time gig, but struggling to break through, what was the big change?</strong></h4><p>Looking for other options, I texted a dear friend, Fanny Lakoubay for advice, as she did remote classes about Art. She replied with a link and a supportive message. <em>“Try Editional App, and have fun with the community”</em>. That was game changing for me. She briefly explained that instead of posting my artwork simply on social media, I could protect it by minting it on the Blockchain.</p><p>Back then, we were a small bunch of artists, most of us wondering what was happening, and we were minting and exchanging Art for free on the ETH blockchain (How crazy is that!). The rest is since History.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NyMecziyRlrv06Sn763IMw.png" /></figure><h4><strong>Okay, let’s circle back around to your art creation because you have a rather distinct style of mixing tangible drawings with digital media. Why is that?</strong></h4><p>Yeah! Since a very young age, I love crafting with everything around me. From the nature to paints, including rocks, leaves, clay, sand, shells, paper cuts, wool, wood, etc… My friends say I’m like Lavoisier, “ Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed” and ever since I keep on creating from bits and pieces.</p><p>So the relationship with materiality, feel the paper, the water, is essential for me. I tried many times to draw on my tablet, with special pens, special textured screen — and I never felt any connection with it — I can draw, but the emotion of creating is not there, and as a kid, I need to enjoy the moment.</p><h4><strong>Woah that is really great to hear, I feel we are losing some of artistic styles as the world moves to a more digital setting. I’m happy you are keeping these mediums alive!</strong></h4><p>Also, I am a strong believer that computers and software tend to frame and influence how we work, as an Executive, I would take breaks from the laptop when I needed to be creative. To me, creativity comes alive with pen and paper. I have hundreds of notebooks, filled with creative ideas that might never have existed if I stayed in front of a digital screen.</p><p>Sounds logical but I can assure you that very few in the office space takes enough break from screens — and let’s think about it — Ideating around a powerpoint will force you to create a bullet point list or a diagram — here we are Formatisation; and it is just an example.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mpTJxJ9kpin-ObDxOdtY3g.png" /></figure><h4><strong>I have to agree, we do so much of our work with a screen, I feel it takes away some of the experience of creation as the computer fills in some of the dots. I recently picked up a sketch book again after drawing solely with Procreate over the last year. What do you enjoy using?</strong></h4><p>So I always start on paper, using a very thick 300g/m2 source from Canson, made for watercolours. Then I simply start drawing, sometimes I’ll mentally create a theme before drawing, and sometimes I dive in without a clear idea — just creating. Letting that uncontainable urge to hit the paper, to me feeling is essential, and I become a drawing machine letting my mind wander around the ink.</p><p>So my process is sketches with pencil, line art with pens, and then finally waatercolours.</p><h4><strong>So you created a tangible piece of art, but you like to add more digital aspects correct?</strong></h4><p>Correct, that is the base, the Analogue Art, which for most traditional artists or illustrators would be enough… But as mentioned I am obsessed on how to augment it, so begins the process of scanning, having created a montage on my desk to create a good quality scans, then using a a multitude of digital tools like Polarr to play with the colours, and Procreate to finalise details, animate, etc.</p><h4><strong>That is really exciting stuff! You enjoy collaboration as well, and moving toward Digital AI?</strong></h4><p>And I usually play with platforms once I minted it, as an NFT, like AsyncArt where I play with the Dynamic Aspect for my NFT with a Night and Day version of the same cryptoArt! and since I am now working a lot with Tagachi (who is this? Link to their work), ideas are flourishing.</p><h4><strong>Let’s move toward your collaboration with .find, how did you two meet? Since we are built on Flow and you are primarily on Ethereum.</strong></h4><p>They found me — Werekitty (discord handle) is one of my most supportive collectors — and I am forever grateful to her as she has supported my Art from the beginning. Collectors like that are so precious.</p><p>Then in 2022, I made a talk at NFC Lisbon about CryptoArt History and finally met Bjartek. That was quite emotional. I wish to one day meet his wife, (Werekitty). At that time, there was no mention of .find and in August, and I had to postpone further the launch of Mignonverse, another project of mine, because of the Bear Market. So I sent a tweet asking if anyone wanted to have an advisor for their project or platform, so that I had a little bit more time for the next few months. And Christian and Bjartek contacted me and I was in love with the idea of .find — here I am!</p><p><strong>And we are happy to have you here Lapin! Thank you for sharing your amazing story with us and I’m excited to see where this collaboration goes as we move forward. Also, I’m interested to see the options people will have to vote on for the PFP images you are creating specifically for .find!</strong></p><p>Find Website: <a href="https://find.xyz/">https://find.xyz/</a> <br>Lapin Mignon Website: <a href="https://www.lapinmignon.co.uk/">https://www.lapinmignon.co.uk/</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=77c5b58ad80e" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>
